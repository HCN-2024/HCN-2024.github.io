Its main focus is the Serre spectral sequence and its applications, but there is also some coverage of the Adams spectral sequence and, more briefly, a few other spectral sequences.

<p><strong>Preprints:</strong></p>

<ul><li>"Moduli spaces of circle packings" (with William Thurston). <a href="Papers/CirclePacking.pdf">pdf file</a> (14 pages) posted March 2018. This is a partial write-up of a project that Bill and I worked on in 2008. The paper contains two theorems, but the proof of one of them is not complete. The remaining details could have been easily filled in by Bill, and my hope is that someone else will be able to do this now.</li>
  <li>"The Kirby torus trick for surfaces". <a href="Papers/TorusTrick.pdf">pdf file</a> (10 pages) posted January 2014 with small revisions in 2022. This is an expository account of two classical theorems in surface topology:  Topological surfaces have unique smooth structures, and homeomorphisms of smooth surfaces are isotopic to diffeomorphisms. With the torus trick, almost no point-set topology is needed for the proofs.</li>
  <li>"A short exposition of the Madsen-Weiss theorem". <a href="Papers/MW.pdf">pdf file</a> (43
    pages). This version posted February 2014. Appendices have been added giving the calculation of the stable rational homology, a proof of the Group Completion Theorem, and the Cerf-Gramain proof that the diffeomorphism groups of most surfaces have contractible components. </li>
    <li>"Simplifying and separating configurations of disjoint unlinked spheres in Euclidean space". <a href="Papers/SphereConfig.pdf">pdf file</a> posted in April 2022.

<p><strong>Updates of older papers:</strong></p>

<ul>

  <li>"Spaces of incompressible surfaces". This is an improved version
of a paper published in Topology in 1976 with the title:
"Homeomorphisms of sufficiently large P^2-irreducible 3-manifolds". <a href="Papers/emb.pdf">pdf file</a> (10 pages) </li>
  <li>"Triangulations of surfaces". The original version of this was
published in Topology and its Applications in 1991. <a href="Papers/TriangSurf.pdf">pdf file</a> (7 pages).</li>
  <li>"On the diffeomorphism group of S^1 x S^2". This is a revision,
written in 2003, of a paper originally published in the AMS Proceedings
in 1981. <a href="Papers/newDiffS1xS2.pdf">pdf file</a> (6 pages).</li>
  <li>"Boundary curves of incompressible surfaces". A rewritten version
of a paper originally published in 1982 in the Pacific Journal. <a href="Papers/bdyslopes.pdf">pdf file</a> (5 pages).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unfinished drafts:</strong></p>
<ul>

  <li>"Diffeomorphism groups of reducible 3-manifolds". This is an
incomplete draft, lacking some proofs, posted in August 2008, replacing
an older version from about 10 years earlier. <a href="Papers/DR3M.pdf">pdf
file</a> (10 pages) </li>
  <li>"Topological moduli spaces of knots". This is also unfinished,
but the aim is to describe the homotopy types of the components of the
space of all knots in the 3-sphere. <a href="Papers/knotspaces.pdf">pdf
file</a> (12 pages) This version posted October, 2002. </li>
  <li>"Measured lamination spaces for 3-manifolds". An unfinished draft
of a paper written in the late 1980's, now converted into TeX and
mildly edited, but with the same mathematical content as the old paper.
    <a href="Papers/ML.pdf">pdf file</a> (36 pages) </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unpublished papers:</strong></p>

<ul>

  <li>"The cyclic cycle complex of a surface". <a href="Papers/cycles.pdf">pdf file</a> (January 2008, 7 pages). This
has been largely superseded by section 2 of the paper "Generating the
Torelli group" with Dan Margalit listed above, which gives an
exposition of the construction of Bestvina-Bux-Margalit that was the
inspiration for "the cyclic cycle complex". Later I realized that the
cell complex constructed by BBM has a canonical triangulation which
makes it a subcomplex of the cyclic cycle complex, so for most purposes
it is probably better to use the smaller BBM complex.</li>
  <li>"Bianchi orbifolds of small discriminant" <a href="Papers/Bianchi.pdf">pdf file</a> (6 pages). This is a brief
report I wrote in 1983 but never published. Here are some <a href="bianchi.html"><b>Pictures of Bianchi orbifolds</b></a>.</li>
  <li>"Curves on the 4-punctured sphere: 31 Charts" (with Bill Floyd).
This is an unpublished paper from around 1980 that you can download as
a  <a href="Papers/31charts/31Charts.pdf">pdf file</a>
(3.8MB) that was made by scanning the original typescript. You can also
view it onscreen <a href="Papers/31charts/thirtyone.html">here</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Slides of Talks:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="Papers/BanffTalk.pdf">Stable homology of spaces of graphs</a>.
    A talk at Banff in December 2012 about an analog of the Madsen-Weiss
    theorem for certain 3-manifolds. There is also an <a href="Papers/StanfordTalk.pdf">earlier version</a> of this talk given
    at Stanford in July 2012.</li>
  <li><a href="Papers/Diff%28M%292012.pdf">A 50-year view of
    diffeomorphism groups</a>. A talk at the 50th Cornell Topology Festival
    in May 2012 sketching some highlights of what's known about the homotopy types of
    diffeomorphism groups of smooth manifolds. A full history would of course be impossible in an hour talk.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong></strong><a href="Papers/luminytalk.pdf">Stable homology
    by scanning: Variations on a theorem of Galatius</a>. A talk at Luminy
    in June 2010 outlining the current simplified form of the proof of
    Galatius' theorem on the stable homology of Aut(F_n), with comments on
    how the Madsen-Weiss theorem follows similarly, as do a couple analogs in dimension three involving handlebodies.</li>
  <li><a href="Papers/3Msurvey.pdf">The classification of 3-manifolds
    -- a brief survey</a>. This is a written version (11 pages) of an
